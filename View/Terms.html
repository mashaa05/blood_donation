            <p>
                By using the Blood For Need platform, you agree to the following terms and conditions.
                These rules are created to ensure ethical, safe, and transparent blood donation practices

            <h3>1. Voluntary Participation</h3>
            <p>
                Blood donation through this platform is completely voluntary. No user is forced or

            </p>

            <h3>2. Eligibility of Donors</h3>
            <p>
                Donors must meet standard medical eligibility requirements, including age, weight,
                and health condition, before donating blood.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Accuracy of Information</h3>
            <p>
                Users must provide correct and truthful personal and medical information. Providing
                false information may lead to account suspension.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Use of Personal Data</h3>
            <p>
                Personal information will be used only for blood donation coordination purposes and
                will not be shared with third parties without consent, unless required by law.
            </p>

            <h3>5. No Financial Transactions</h3>
            <p>
                Blood For Need does not support or allow buying or selling of blood. Any form of
                financial demand related to blood donation is strictly prohibited.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Medical Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                Blood For Need acts only as a connecting platform. It is not responsible for any
                medical complications, transfusion outcomes, or health-related issues.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Respectful Conduct</h3>
            <p>
                All users must communicate respectfully. Harassment, abuse, or inappropriate behavior
                will not be tolerated.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Emergency Situations</h3>
            <p>
                While the platform helps connect donors and recipients, it does not guarantee immediate
                donor availability in emergency cases.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Account Suspension</h3>
            <p>
                Blood For Need reserves the right to suspend or permanently remove any account that
                violates these terms and conditions.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Changes to Terms</h3>

                These terms and conditions may be updated at any time. Continued use of the platform
                means acceptance of the updated terms.
